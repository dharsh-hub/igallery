            It's become a gleaming, modern tourist magnet, complete with condos, theme parks, and brand-new resorts.
            But the city's earlier charm is still present, including laid-back, friendly locals and incredible street eats. 
            After you've stuffed yourself with a bowl of Mi Quang and Banh Mi Ba Lan, walk it off by exploring the limestone caves and Buddhist grottos of the Marble Mountains.
            Make an escape to the surreal mountain resort of Ba Na Hills, where the majestic Golden Bridge welcomes you with open palms." >

            stopping at spectacular caves through which visitors can wander, viewing impressive, centuries-old formations.
            Ha Long Bay's mystical beauty has made it a bucket list attraction within the country, but it's still possible to find secluded corners to call your own. " >

            Wandering these tree-lined lanes past crumbling colonial facades will transport you back in time. 
            However, today's Hanoi is about much more than the past. The ancient city is being invigorated with modern cafes, world-class restaurants, and cool art galleries.">

            Backdrops don't get much more spectacular. Enticing ribbons of road lead the eye down to the valley floor, white-water rivers rush among rice fields, 
            and lush green mountains stretch into the distance as far as the eye can see. The highest peak in the region, Mount Fansipan, crowns the ragged ridge line high above town.">
